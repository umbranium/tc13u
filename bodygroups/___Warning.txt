WARNING!

It is not guaranteed that all bodygroups have a corresponding texture, 
or that all textures are named in such a way that make it easily distinguishable 
which texture belongs to which bodygroup.

The bodygroup collection was assembled from various sources, and is just a general collection of
"raw data" you can use to create your models.

The only bodygroups i can guarantee the integrity of is the ARC-PAC, because it was made by me.

Also most of them are off-position and need repositioning.
In other words, either don't use them or fix them first.
TC12 import bodygroups should work fine though.

DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT MISSING TEXTURES!
PLEASE ADD A PULL REQUEST IF YOU FIND/MAKE ANY MORE BODYGROUPS/TEXTURES AND WOULD LIKE TO ADD/SHARE THEM HERE
THE BIGGER THIS COLLECTION IS THE BETTER FOR EVERYONE
